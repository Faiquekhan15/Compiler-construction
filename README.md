# Compiler-construction
This repository contains some of the programs that receive a string input from a user and show if the string is true or false according to our own defined language, similar to other programming languages. If the character fits the conditions successfully, it will move to the next state, i.e. 0->1, but if the string does not meet the rules, it will stop, and the string will be trapped in an infinite state.
